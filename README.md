# Mithra<sup>1</sup>LIMSims

This is the public repository for the **Mithra Line Intensity Mapping Simulations (MithraLIMSims)**. This repository is an extension to [HiddenValleySims](https://github.com/modichirag/HiddenValleySims) that provides code snippets to access and analysis a suite of simulated intensity (brightness temprature) maps of CO and [CII] lines in the following publication arxiv:2111.XXXXX. 

The mesheded fileds from MithraLIMSims are publically avilable on [MithraLIMSims](http://cyril.astro.berkeley.edu/MithraLIMSims). As discussed in the paper, this code can be straightforwardly extended to generate the mesheded fileds of other emission lines (emitted from star-froming galaxies), beside CO and [CII].

The code is written in python3 and uses the following dependencies:
- [pmesh](https://github.com/rainwoodman/pmesh)
- [nbodykit](https://github.com/bccp/nbodykit)
- [bigfile](https://github.com/rainwoodman/bigfile) 

This repository is under active developement.
